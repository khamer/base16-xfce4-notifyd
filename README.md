# base16-xfce4-notifyd

This repository is meant to work with
[chriskempson/base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).
It provides a simple template that can be used with the base16 color schemes to
generate a functional config file for xfce-notify-4.0.

To use, you can copy one of these folders into ~/.themes or use curl:

```
mkdir -p ~/.themes/base16-default/xfce-notify-4.0
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khamer/base16-xfce4-notifyd/master/themes/base16-default-dark/xfce-notify-4.0/gtk.css >> ~/.themes/base16-default/xfce-notify-4.0/gtk.css
```
